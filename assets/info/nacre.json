    "bio": "Marion Camy-Palou approaches music through three projects - Nacre, Deeat Palace and Officine - by playing various electric and electronic instruments but with a common purpose: to deconstruct the codes of classical musical compositions and to search for unusual sound forms. Having already worked with highly saturated guitars in the trio Officine, she undertakes with Nacre to create a memento of sound projections using a guitar, an amp and effect pedals. Crashes, harsh sinusoids, layers, personal mantras make for a raw and furious live performance.",
