    "bio": "Jon Leidecker (aka Wobbly) is a human in the loop, making music with people and machines that listen.  Improvising with recorded sounds, his emphasis on live performance blurs any clear distinction between his solo and collaborative work, which includes touring and recording with Negativland, the Thurston Moore Group, Jennifer Walshe, Zoh Amba, Dieter Moebius & Tim Story, Matmos, People Like Us, Fred Frith, Tania Chen, Sagan and Huun-Huur-Tu.  Labels that have released his music include Hausu Mountain, Illegal Art, Deathbomb Arc, Bureau B.  His lectures on the secret histories of electronic music have been presented at Mills, Stanford, Oxford, UC Berkeley / Davis / Santa Cruz, MACBA and Peabody Conservatory.  In 2015 he inherited Negativland's long-running Over The Edge radio live mix program, which continues to broadcast KPFA FM in Berkeley.",
